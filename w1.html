            <h2>When Did WWII Start?</h2>
            <p>
                World War II began on September 1, 1939, when Germany, under Adolf Hitler's leadership, invaded Poland.
                This invasion prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany on September 3, 1939, marking the
                beginning of a global conflict. Although this date is considered the official start, tensions had been
                building throughout the 1930s due to Germany's aggressive policies and Japan's imperial ambitions in
                Asia. The war eventually escalated into a full-scale global conflict that lasted for six years.
                <br><br>
                The roots of the war can also be traced back to unresolved issues from World War I, especially the harsh
                conditions imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Hitler's rise to power in 1933 further
                destabilized Europe, as he pursued policies aimed at reversing Germany's territorial losses and
                rebuilding its military strength.

            <h2>How Did WWII Start?</h2>
            <p>
                World War II began due to a combination of political, economic, and territorial tensions. Adolf Hitler's
                expansionist policies aimed at creating "Lebensraum" (living space) for the German people were a major
                factor. In the late 1930s, Germany annexed Austria and the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, actions that
                were met with appeasement by Western democracies. However, when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Britain
                and France decided that appeasement had failed and declared war on Germany.
                <br><br>
                The war also saw the Axis Powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—pursue aggressive expansion. Japan invaded
                China in 1937, Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, and Germany focused on Europe. These actions, combined
                with the inability of the League of Nations to prevent aggression, created the conditions for a global
                conflict. The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact signed in 1939 further emboldened Hitler, as it ensured
                that Germany would not face a two-front war initially.

            <h2>Why Did WWII Start?</h2>
            <p>
                The causes of World War II are rooted in the aftermath of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, which
                imposed harsh penalties on Germany. These penalties created economic hardship and political instability,
                leading to the rise of extremist ideologies. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party capitalized on German
                resentment and sought to overturn the treaty, rebuild the military, and expand territory.
                <br><br>
                Imperial ambitions also played a significant role. Japan sought to dominate Asia, while Italy aimed to
                expand its influence in Africa and Europe. The failure of the League of Nations to address these
                aggressions allowed Axis Powers to pursue their goals unchecked. The combination of unresolved tensions,
                expansionist policies, and appeasement eventually made war inevitable.

            <p>
                World War II started in Europe with Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. This marked the
                beginning of the war in the European theater. However, the Pacific theater began earlier, with Japan's
                invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and full-scale war with China in 1937. These conflicts eventually merged
                into the larger global war.
                <br><br>
                The war spread rapidly to other parts of the world. By 1941, Germany had invaded much of Western Europe,
                while Japan launched attacks on Southeast Asia and the Pacific, including the infamous bombing of Pearl
                Harbor on December 7, 1941, which brought the United States into the war. Battles were fought on multiple
                fronts, including North Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Pacific islands, making it a truly global
                conflict.

            <h2>Who Were Involved in WWII?</h2>
            <p>
                World War II involved two major alliances: the Axis Powers and the Allied Powers. The Axis Powers
                included Germany, Italy, and Japan, while the Allies consisted of Britain, the United States, the Soviet
                Union, China, and France, along with numerous other nations. The war drew in countries from every
                continent, making it a truly global conflict.
                <br><br>
                The war also saw significant contributions from colonial troops and resistance movements. Soldiers from
                British India, African colonies, and other territories played vital roles. The conflict involved over 100
                million people in total, including civilians, who faced unimaginable suffering due to bombings,
                occupation, and genocide, including the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six million Jews.

            <h2>How Long Did WWII Last?</h2>
            <p>
                World War II lasted for six years, from September 1, 1939, to September 2, 1945. The war in Europe ended
                on May 8, 1945, with Germany's surrender, known as VE Day (Victory in Europe Day). However, the war in
                the Pacific continued until Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945, following the dropping of atomic
                bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
                <br><br>
                The war's duration and scale made it one of the most devastating conflicts in history. Over 70 million
                people lost their lives, including soldiers and civilians, and the world was forever changed. The war
                also marked the beginning of the Cold War, as tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States
                emerged in its aftermath.
