            <h2>When Did WWI Start?</h2>
            <p>
                World War I officially began on July 28, 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
                of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914. This pivotal event set off a chain reaction among the major
                European powers. Over the course of a month, diplomatic relations soured as nations issued ultimatums,
                mobilized their armies, and prepared for conflict. Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, declared war on
                Serbia after Serbia failed to fully comply with their ultimatum. This marked the start of one of the
                deadliest conflicts in human history.
                <br><br>
                Initially, many believed the war would be over by Christmas of 1914. However, the combination of military
                alliances, unresolved political tensions, and militaristic ambitions meant that the war quickly escalated
                into a global catastrophe. By August 1914, major powers like Russia, Germany, and Britain had joined
                the fray, initiating a total war that lasted over four years.

            <h2>How Did WWI Start?</h2>
            <p>
                The spark that ignited World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the
                Austro-Hungarian throne, by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. The assassination, carried
                out in Sarajevo, was rooted in rising nationalist tensions within the Balkans. Serbia sought to expand its
                influence in the region, while Austria-Hungary aimed to suppress any uprisings. The Austro-Hungarian
                Empire, with Germany's support, issued an ultimatum to Serbia, knowing it would be almost impossible to
                accept without compromising sovereignty.
                <br><br>
                Serbia’s partial acceptance of the ultimatum wasn’t enough for Austria-Hungary, and war was declared.
                However, this regional conflict quickly spiraled into a global war due to pre-existing military alliances
                and agreements. The Central Powers—Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire—found themselves
                opposed by the Allies, which included France, Russia, and the British Empire.

            <h2>Why Did WWI Start?</h2>
            <p>
                The underlying causes of World War I were complex and interconnected. A mix of militarism, alliances,
                imperialism, and nationalism had been brewing tensions for decades. Militarism had created an arms race
                among European powers, with each nation building larger and more powerful armies. Alliances such as the
                Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain)
                divided Europe into two hostile blocs.
                <br><br>
                Imperial ambitions added fuel to the fire, as nations competed for colonies and resources across Africa
                and Asia. Nationalism, particularly in regions like the Balkans, created further instability. The desire
                of ethnic groups to form independent nations clashed with the territorial ambitions of empires. By 1914,
                Europe was a powder keg, and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was the match that lit the fuse.

            <p>
                World War I began in the Balkans, specifically in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the time, this
                region was under the control of Austria-Hungary, but it was a hotspot for nationalist movements seeking
                independence. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo by a member of the Serbian
                nationalist group, the Black Hand, set the stage for the conflict. From this initial event, the war spread
                rapidly across Europe and eventually to other continents, including Africa and Asia.
                <br><br>
                The geography of Europe played a crucial role in the spread of the war. The close proximity of rival
                nations and the extensive railway networks allowed for rapid mobilization and deployment of troops.
                Battles were fought across multiple fronts, from the Western Front in France and Belgium to the Eastern
                Front in Russia.

            <h2>Who Were Involved in WWI?</h2>
            <p>
                World War I involved most of the world's great powers, divided into two major alliances: the Central
                Powers and the Allies. The Central Powers consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and
                Bulgaria. The Allies included France, Russia, Britain, and later Italy, Japan, and the United States.
                Over 30 countries eventually became involved in the war, either through direct military action or by
                providing support.
                <br><br>
                The war also saw the participation of millions of colonial troops from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.
                Soldiers from British India, French West Africa, and other territories fought on behalf of their colonial
                rulers. The sheer scale of participation made WWI a truly global conflict.

            <h2>How Long Did WWI Last?</h2>
            <p>
                World War I lasted for over four years, from July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918. The war ended with the
                signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, which brought an official ceasefire on the Western Front. The
                Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, formalized the end of the war and imposed harsh penalties on
                Germany, setting the stage for future conflicts.
                <br><br>
                Despite initial hopes for a quick war, the realities of trench warfare, technological advances, and the
                global scale of the conflict led to a prolonged and devastating war. By the end, over 20 million people
                had died, and the world was forever changed.
